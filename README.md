[*SparkFun Qwiic Pocket Development Board - ESP32-C6 (DEV-22925)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/22925)

The SparkFun Qwiic Pocket Development Board - ESP32-C6 is designed to fit in the 1"x1" Qwiic standard size making it easy to add a powerful wireless development platform that stacks into any existing project using the [Qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic). It features the ESP32-C6 Mini-1 module from espressif<sup>&trade;</sup>. We designed this board with components on both sides of the PCB to squeeze as many features as possible into its tiny footprint including a USB-C connector, Qwiic connector, 2-pin JST battery connector with on-board charging circuit, as well as two buttons for Reset and Boot. The design also works to optimize power consumption and in our testing we measured total current consumption by the board to be ~14&micro;A in Deep Sleep mode making it a great fit for remote, battery-powered applications.
